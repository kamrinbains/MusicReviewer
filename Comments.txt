4/24 Nick - Heres what I did today so far
-Added static/ folder for CSS and its input/output for Tailwind.
-I think(?) I reinstalled Django since there was some weird error I had so I re-ran it
-Updated settings.py for the static files and to look in the templates/ folder
-Installed Tailwind, PostCSS & Autoprefixer
^ Regarding tailwind, unless you can find a way to get it to fully initalize as Tailwind 4.0, I kept running into issues
so I hand-created tailwind.config.js & postcss.config.js and built static/css/output.css via npx postcss.
I actually had ChatGPT do the process for me since I had no clue how to initalize it otherwise, but you can find a 
rundown in the TailWindExplanation.txt file I added.

- Also added templates/base.html (loads output.css)

- and created templates/home.html and updated app1/views.py + urls.py
- I also ran makemigrations/migrate but we got no models yet
- Launched server, confirmed “Welcome to MusicReviewer” styled by Tailwind that you can see in the templates/home.html

I may have forgotten some stuff but this should be most of what I did for now.

4/24 Kamrin - I restarted the project just to clean it up
- I ran the command:
	npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
- Added the import - @import "tailwindcss";
- Created a script in package.json for watch:css
- Created static folder in the root directory
- Created css folder in static to hold input and output
- Added browser auto refresh for any static changes (basically changes to css or html)
___________________________________IMPORTANT___________________________________________
- I had to restart the django project so your changes were lost
- Tailwind is working correctly and to run the server, open 2 terminals and run each of
the following commands:
    1. npm run watch:css
    2. python manage.py runserver
- Leave the terminals running and make any edits on html or static files and the browser
will automatically refresh, ctrl-c to stop

- Any html files you create (that do not extend the base.html file) will need to have
these 2 lines at the top:
    {% load static %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'dist/styles.css' %}">

- The rest below is just stuff that can help you understand the project structure

- There are 2 template directories, one in the root directory and one under app1
    - The one in the root directory is for the base.html file
    - The one under app1 is for the home.html file (where we would put other pages)
- The static folder is in the root directory and will hold our static files

- Look at both html files in both template directories
    - The base.html file is the main template that will be used for all pages
    - The home.html file is the page that will be displayed when the server is running
- We can use the {% block %} tag to define sections of the base.html file that can be overridden
    - For example, the {% block content %} tag in the base.html file is where we can
    put the content for each page
    - The {% extends %} tag in the index.html file tells Django to use the base.html
    file as the main template


- The next thing I think to work on is fixing the base template to get it looking how we want
and to contain a navbar and footer, I can work on it or if you get to it first let me know
- Or you can work on a gameplan for implementing the music api, i will let you know what I work on next

4/27 Nick what I did
so today (And 4/28) I added the user token for the Discogs API and incorporated it into the settings/views/urls page etc.
Along with that I created and organized index.html (Home) and made the search_results.html page,
I also made a super suepr basic and shitty homepage layout with a search bar and featured album section. but its scuffed asf and needs work,
In fact I will progress with that this week as well, also the Django package didnt seem to be initilaized properly so I fixed it lol all good
We'll discuss more of this soon, hope to get most of the bulk done this week.

4/28 Nick what i did today
- made a review, contact, about .html pages
- contact page well have it so it actually doesnt submit anything but seems like it does
- ­included app1.urls in music/urls.py so all app routes resolve and work
- the search results page for the "Write a Review" passes album title and artist dynamically through the urls
- also updated views.py to handle dynamic album and artist data for the review page.
- Next up is like making the home page look good and also adding a review model to store info, and also making user accounts
I kind of forgot about that so far but is simple and can probably rip it from the chess board
