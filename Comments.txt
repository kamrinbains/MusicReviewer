4/24 Nick - Heres what I did today so far
-Added static/ folder for CSS and its input/output for Tailwind.
-I think(?) I reinstalled Django since there was some weird error I had so I re-ran it
-Updated settings.py for the static files and to look in the templates/ folder
-Installed Tailwind, PostCSS & Autoprefixer
^ Regarding tailwind, unless you can find a way to get it to fully initalize as Tailwind 4.0, I kept running into issues
so I hand-created tailwind.config.js & postcss.config.js and built static/css/output.css via npx postcss.
I actually had ChatGPT do the process for me since I had no clue how to initalize it otherwise, but you can find a 
rundown in the TailWindExplanation.txt file I added.

- Also added templates/base.html (loads output.css)

- and created templates/home.html and updated app1/views.py + urls.py
- I also ran makemigrations/migrate but we got no models yet
- Launched server, confirmed “Welcome to MusicReviewer” styled by Tailwind that you can see in the templates/home.html

I may have forgotten some stuff but this should be most of what I did for now.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
4/24 Kamrin - I restarted the project just to clean it up
- I ran the command:
	npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
- Added the import - @import "tailwindcss";
- Created a script in package.json for watch:css
- Created static folder in the root directory
- Created css folder in static to hold input and output
- Added browser auto refresh for any static changes (basically changes to css or html)
___________________________________IMPORTANT___________________________________________
- I had to restart the django project so your changes were lost
- Tailwind is working correctly and to run the server, open 2 terminals and run each of
the following commands:
    1. npm run watch:css
    2. python manage.py runserver
- Leave the terminals running and make any edits on html or static files and the browser
will automatically refresh, ctrl-c to stop

- Any html files you create (that do not extend the base.html file) will need to have
these 2 lines at the top:
    {% load static %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'dist/styles.css' %}">

- The rest below is just stuff that can help you understand the project structure

- There are 2 template directories, one in the root directory and one under app1
    - The one in the root directory is for the base.html file
    - The one under app1 is for the home.html file (where we would put other pages)
- The static folder is in the root directory and will hold our static files

- Look at both html files in both template directories
    - The base.html file is the main template that will be used for all pages
    - The home.html file is the page that will be displayed when the server is running
- We can use the {% block %} tag to define sections of the base.html file that can be overridden
    - For example, the {% block content %} tag in the base.html file is where we can
    put the content for each page
    - The {% extends %} tag in the index.html file tells Django to use the base.html
    file as the main template


- The next thing I think to work on is fixing the base template to get it looking how we want
and to contain a navbar and footer, I can work on it or if you get to it first let me know
- Or you can work on a gameplan for implementing the music api, i will let you know what I work on next

4/27 Nick what I did
so today (And 4/28) I added the user token for the Discogs API and incorporated it into the settings/views/urls page etc.
Along with that I created and organized index.html (Home) and made the search_results.html page,
I also made a super suepr basic and shitty homepage layout with a search bar and featured album section. but its scuffed asf and needs work,
In fact I will progress with that this week as well, also the Django package didnt seem to be initilaized properly so I fixed it lol all good
We'll discuss more of this soon, hope to get most of the bulk done this week.

4/28 Nick what i did today
- made a review, contact, about .html pages
- contact page well have it so it actually doesnt submit anything but seems like it does
- ­included app1.urls in music/urls.py so all app routes resolve and work
- the search results page for the "Write a Review" passes album title and artist dynamically through the urls
- also updated views.py to handle dynamic album and artist data for the review page.
- Next up is like making the home page look good and also adding a review model to store info, and also making user accounts
I kind of forgot about that so far but is simple and can probably rip it from the chess board
_______________________________________________________________________________________
4/29 Kamrin - 
- Changed frontend styling mostly
- Removed Review from the Navbar:
	>I don't think it should be in the navbar as, for now, the only way to get an album there is by going to the search page, searching an album, then clicking review. It makes sense to have the review page in the navbar if you can search an album and click it from a list (while still on the review page)
	>To add it back just add 
		<a href="/review">Review</a>
	to the base.html navbar component
- Changed navbar layout and added account on the right hand side
- For the navbar, I added a log in / account button, however they aren't linked to any pages. When we make the pages that specific part of the navbar will look something like this:
	
      {% if user.is_authenticated %}
        <a href="{% url 'account' %}"
           class="ml-4 px-3 py-1 bg-white text-blue-600 rounded hover:bg-gray-100">
          Account
        </a>
      {% else %}
        <a href="{% url 'login' %}"
           class="ml-4 px-3 py-1 bg-white text-blue-600 rounded hover:bg-gray-100">
          Log In
        </a>


- I decided to use Ionicons for adding icons, such as the user icon on the navbar. Had me add a script on the bottom of the base.html template.

- Also for the contact page, I can add the functionality for that and it shouldn't take me long. I just need an email to create an account. I might just make a bs gmail account for this, just think of a name for the website and I'll make the email after it

- Need to make a login page and maybe account page for details on there account (if they want to change their email or password for example)
- Need to create the model for users in Django and then brainstorm how we want to save reviews and display them to other users
_______________________________________________________________________________________
4/30 Nick
Created the reviews model to store from user
-added login and account, but need to make it login from the get-go like chess site

_______________________________________________________________________________________
5/5 Kamrin
